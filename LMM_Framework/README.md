# Linear Mixed Effects Model â€“ Maternal Mental Health & Infant Sleep

This notebook explores how different aspects of maternal mental health might relate to infant sleep quality, using a **Linear Mixed Effects Model**. It works with repeated measures over time and includes covariates to account for possible confounding factors.

## What This Notebook Does

- Reshapes the dataset into a **long format** so repeated measures can be modeled properly  
- Lets you define your own:
  - **Predictors** (e.g., prenatal depression, anxiety, sleep issues)
  - **Outcomes** (e.g., BISQ sleep quality scores)
  - **Covariates** (e.g., maternal age, socioeconomic status)
- Includes a built-in function to **check how complete the data is** across any group of columns, great for spotting where missing data might be a problem
- Fits a **mixed model** with a random intercept for each subject to account for within-subject variation
- Outputs a full summary of model coefficients and p-values 

## Modularity and Reusability

The code is built to be **modular and flexible**, making it easy to try out different predictors, outcomes, or covariates to explore new hypotheses.
